# Egg-Timer
A fun python project for perfect eggs every time!
This egg timer is a command-line code built enitrely using python modules. It helps users cook eggs by automatically calculating and timing the correct cooking duration based on egg type and quantity. It acts as an interactive kitchen assistant rather than a countdown timer.
Problem Statement: Different styles of eggs require different cooking times, and are easy to over and undercook. Many users find it difficult to judge this duration accurately, hence a simple timer does not suffice.
Objectives: To create a program that- •Takes user input for egg type and quantity •Calculates an approapriate cooking duration based on these inputs •Displays and runs a real-time countdown for this duration 
Components(modules) Used: Time, Datetime, Sys
Functionalities: Offers 4 options for eggs (soft boiled, hard boiled, sunny side up, fluffy omelette), Supports batch cooking for up to 6 eggs, Displays aesthetically pleasing visuals
